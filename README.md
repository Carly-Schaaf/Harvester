With Harvester, you can find and harvest local produce right in your own neighborhood. This project was built with Node.js, React, Apollo Client, GraphQL, and MongoDB.

Leveraging GraphQLâ€™s easy integration of multiple data sources, I incorporated the Wikipedia API in order to add photos and a description to user-entered produce, which entailed adding those fields and their respective resolve function to my GraphQL ProduceType (pictured below).

Users can also search by produce name and location. I implemented this search feature using Mongoose's regex method (pictured below) and the Google Geocoding API.

The following modal allows users to review produce. After the review is submitted, I manually update the Apollo InMemoryCache so the user can see the review immediately upon submission.

This project was designed and built in under two weeks.
